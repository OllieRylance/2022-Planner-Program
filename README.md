# 2022-Planner-Program
This system was mainly for storing A-Level tasks, but I repurposed it as a general planner. I found it more efficient than other task trackers, so I used it to manage my to-do list throughout the year.

## Things I learned from the project

- Making modifications to a poorly structured and commented program is very tricky:
  - Adding relatively simple features like grouping was very difficult,
  - The code clearly could be a lot more efficient now that I am looking back in 2024 and I would have a lot of tips for 17-year-old me if I could go back,
- How to use code in daily life to make it a tiny bit easier while practicing core skills such as logical reasoning and ways to think about projects larger than the psuedocode we had to interpret or write in exam papers.
